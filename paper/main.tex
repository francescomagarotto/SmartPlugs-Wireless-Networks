\section{Introduction}
Nowadays, keeping track of the domestic energy usage is a common scenario in domotic applications that aim to monitor the real-time watt consumption of home appliances. In most cases the solution is a sensor connected to the main safety switch yielding the total energy consumption. Our approach, to get more detailed information and to have control on the use of power by the appliances, is to have an energy sensor for each plug connected to the 220V line. In the following paragraphs, we present our \textit{proof of concept} (POC) which, functionally, consists of three main components: the smart plugs, the main server and the web interface. In our POC, we have modified the architecture described in \cite{8110428} obtaining a specific low-energy consume-driven infrastructure. This consists of: the smart plugs, a central processing unit (for the main server) and a device (for the web interface). In a home scenario these devices are connected to the home wireless router. The communication between smart plugs and server occur over UDP with a simple form of reliability implemented at the application level. Let's now consider a use case example: the user sets the maximum power consumption possible in the home and then turns on two appliances. When this happens for the first time the system decides, based on the type of appliance connected, a default value for the maximum power usage of the appliance. This value is then updated to reflect the real maximum power usage of the appliance. Now that the system is running and some appliances are turned on, the user will be able to switch on only the appliances that consume less then the available power. Our POC covers this use case and shows that such a system can be practical and useful and that the traffic generated isn't enough to sensibly worsen the performances of the typical home WLAN. To summarize, the system keeps the power usage from reaching the maximum limit set by the user by forbidding the power on of appliances that consume more then the available power. It also gives granular information about the devices consumption and allows the user to turn on or off appliances remotely (via web interface). Aside from the main use case, in the age of climate awareness, such a system could be interesting to an environmentally conscious user that can monitor the power usage of appliances but also could set the maximum power consumption to be lower then the real one in order to use less power or save money. 

\section{General architecture}
As we already said, the architecture implemented is different from the usually provided by this type of system, also because the modern infrastructure relies on cloud computing or external services. Our implementation do not share information about the user, and keeps all the data in the main server, eventually providing the possibility to accessed from outside. Anyway, in this case is not true that a cloud-computing is better, even if is more scalable, if there is no power available at home, the plugs will not be managed correctly either in a decentralized infrastructure. Even worse in a cloud based system, the plugs could not work properly, if there is no internet connection.

%\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}
%
%The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
%column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
%alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
%measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
%and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
%as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
%Please do not revise any of the current designations.
%
%\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
%Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
%separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
%formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
%proofreading, spelling and grammar.
%
%Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
%formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
%for you.
%
%\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
%Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
%even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
%IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
%abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.
%
%\subsection{Units}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
%\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
%\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
%\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsection{Equations}
%Number equations consecutively. To make your 
%equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
%appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
%but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
%sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
%sentence, as in:
%\begin{equation}
%a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
%\end{equation}
%
%Be sure that the 
%symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
%the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
%the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''
%
%\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}
%
%Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
%of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
%to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
%citations without having to go through the file line by line.
%
%Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
%\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
%environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.
%
%Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
%will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
%equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
%article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
%the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
%counting.
%
%{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
%data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
%bibliography you must send the .bib files. 
%
%{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
%subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
%referenced as Table IV-B3. 
%
%{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
%\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
%supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
%cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
%should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.
%
%Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
%will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
%any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
%surrounding equation.
%
%\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
%\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
%\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
%\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
%\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
%\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
%\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
%\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
%\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
%\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
%\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
%\end{itemize}
%An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.
%
%\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
%\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
%minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
%should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
%next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
%and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
%affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
%example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).
%
%\subsection{Identify the Headings}
%Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
%your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.
%
%Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
%topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
%References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
%``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
%table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
%style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
%down menu to differentiate the head from the text.
%
%Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
%example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
%material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
%sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
%and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
%should be introduced.
%
%\subsection{Figures and Tables}
%\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
%bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
%figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
%below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
%figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
%``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

%
%Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
%rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
%avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
%``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
%units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
%with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
%\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
%quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
%``Temperature/K''.
%
%\section*{Acknowledgment}
%
%The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
%an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
%G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
%acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
